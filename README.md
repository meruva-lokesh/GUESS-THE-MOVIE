##  How to Play

````

## Technologies Used

* **HTML** — Interface and structure
* **CSS** — Styles and layout
* **JavaScript** (`app.js`, `movies.js`) — Game logic and dataset

---

## How It Works (Optional Breakdown)

* `movies.js` defines an array/list of movie objects, e.g.:

  ```js
  const movies = [
    { title: "Inception", hint: "A mind-bending dream heist" },
    { title: "Titanic", hint: "A tragic ship romance" },
    // ...
  ];
  ```

* `app.js` handles:

  * Displaying a random movie hint.
  * Capturing user input.
  * Checking the guess and showing feedback.
  * Tracking score, attempts, or similarly fun features (if any).

---

## Possible Enhancements

* Add a scoring system or timer.
* Show movie posters or images.
* Allow multiple levels or categories (genres, decades).
* Enable keyboard input or hint reveal options.
* Make it mobile-first/responsive if not already.
